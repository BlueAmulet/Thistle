Thistle config for cc65
=======================
The files contained in this directory can be used in cc65, allowing you to code with ca65 or in C with cc65. The thistle.cfg is for programs intended to be booted by the eeprom, and the thistle-eeprom.cfg is for doing eeprom development.

Example usage:
```
$ cc65 -t none -O --cpu 65c02 main.c
$ ca65 --cpu 65c02 main.s
$ ld65 -C thistle.cfg -m main.map main.o thistle.lib
```

Compiling the boot rom:
```
ca65 --cpu 65c02 boot.s
ld65 -o boot.rom -C thistle-eeprom.cfg -m boot.map boot.o
```
